Human Emotion Detection ðŸŽ­

This project uses advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify human emotions from facial expressions, voice data, or other relevant input. The aim is to build an intelligent system capable of recognizing and classifying emotions, which can be applied in various fields such as mental health, customer feedback, and human-computer interaction.

Features
Real-time Emotion Recognition: Detect emotions from live data (e.g., webcam feed or audio input).
Multi-modal Analysis: Supports emotion detection from facial expressions, voice, or text input.
Pretrained Models: Leverages deep learning models for accurate predictions.
Scalability: The system is designed to be extendable to support more emotion categories or data types.
Technologies Used
Python: For scripting and building the project.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for model training and inference.
OpenCV: For facial expression detection and preprocessing.
